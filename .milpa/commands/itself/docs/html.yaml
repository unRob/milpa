summary: Renders or displays HTML documentation for all commands
description: |
  Renders documentation for all known milpa commands, and all `docs` folders. Requires docker to be installed and running. To learn more about milpa docs, check out [`milpa help docs milpa repo docs`](/.milpa/docs/milpa/repo/docs.md).

  By default, documentation will be served from `http://localhost:8118` and if a browser is configured to open websites from the terminal, it'll open at that address.

summary: Installs a milpa repo
description: |
  Installs a milpa repo from a local directory or remote git repository into either:

  - `$XDG_DATA_HOME/milpa` (usually `$HOME/.local/share`): by default, or if `--user` is specified, or
  - `$MILPA_ROOT` (usually, /usr/local/lib/milpa), if `--global` is specified.

  When `SOURCE` points to a local path (either a folder containing a `.milpa` folder, or the `.milpa` folder itself), `milpa repo install` will symlink it into the local or global repositories.

  Oherwise,`SOURCE` will be interpreted as a [git URL](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#_git_urls), and a shallow clone will be performed against the `.milpa` folder of the repo only.

  ### Examples

  - `https://github.com/unRob/dotfiles.git` would download the `.milpa` folder from the `unRob/dotfiles` github repo, using **https**, and prompting for credentials for private repos.
  - `git@git.rob.mx/unRob/dotfiles.git` would download the `.milpa` folder from the `unRob/dotfiles` git repo using **ssh credentials**, useful for skipping credential prompts for private repos.
  - `~/.dotfiles` would symlink `$HOME/.dotfiles/.milpa` to the target. An alternative to this is to set `MILPA_PATH` to `$HOME/.dotfiles` (see [`milpa help docs milpa environment`](/.milpa/docs/milpa/environment.md)).

summary: Installs a milpa repo
description: |
  Fetches a milpa repo and installs it to any of three locations:

  - The path specified by the `TARGET` argument, if provided,
  - In the `$MILPA_ROOT` (by default, /usr/local/lib/milpa), if `--global` is specified, or
  - In `$XDG_DATA_HOME/milpa` folder, if `--user` is specified.

  Repos will be fetched from the `.milpa` subdirectory of `SOURCE`, which must be an URL as specified by [go-getter](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter#url-format). Basically, an https, git, hg, s3 or gcs URL.

  ### Examples

  - `github.com/unRob/milpa` would download the `.milpa` folder from the `unRob/milpa` github repo, using **http**, and prompting for credentials for private repos.
  - `git::ssh://git@github.com/unRob/milpa.git//internal` would download the `internal/.milpa` folder from the `unRob/milpa` github repo using **ssh credentials**, useful for skipping credential prompts for private repos

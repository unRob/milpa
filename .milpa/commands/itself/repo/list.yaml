description: |
  `milpa` installs repositories from remote locations at two different locations:

    - machine-wide repositories are installed to `$MILPA_ROOT`, usually at `/usr/local/lib/milpa`,
    - user-specific repositories are installed to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/milpa` folder, usually `$HOME/.local/share/milpa/`

  For more information on installing packages, see [`milpa itself repo install --help`](/.milpa/commands/itself/repo/install.md)

summary: Generates shell completion scripts
description: |
  Generates a shell completion script for the current `$SHELL`. It currently supports `bash`, `fish` and `zsh`. It will write a `(_)milpa` file in your shell's completion function folder:

  - for `bash`, either `/etc/bash_completion.d` or `/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d`
  - for `zsh`, whatever is first in `$fpath`, for example: `/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions`
  - for `fish`, `$HOME/.config/fish/completions/`

  You'll **need to reload your shell** (for example, by restarting your terminal), and make sure **your shell's completion system is enabled**!

  This command only needs to run once.

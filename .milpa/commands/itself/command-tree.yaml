summary: Prints a tree of known commands
description: |
  Prints out command names and descriptions, or optionally a nested representation of all properties of commands, serialized as `json` or `yaml`. Custom textual representations of commands can be obtained by using the `--template` option and specifying a [go-template](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template#hdr-Actions) to be applied to every command. See [chinampa/pkg.Command](https://pkg.go.dev/git.rob.mx/nidito/chinampa/pkg/command#Command) and [milpa/internal/command.Meta](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/unrob/milpa/internal/command#Meta) for references on the structs available during template rendering.

  ## Examples

  ```sh
  # print all known subcommands
  milpa itself command-tree

  # print a tree of milpa itself sub-commands
  milpa itself command-tree itself

  # get all commands as a json tree
  milpa itself command-tree --output json

  # same, but as the yaml representation of this command itself
  milpa itself command-tree --output json itself command-tree

  # print out all commands, skipping groups
  milpa itself command-tree --template '{{ if (not (eq .Command.Meta.Kind "virtual")) }}{{ .Command.FullName }}'$'\n''{{ end }}'
  ```

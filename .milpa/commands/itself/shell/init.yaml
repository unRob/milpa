summary: Initializes shells
description: |
  Running `!milpa! itself shell init` will look for shell scripts named `.milpa/hooks/shell-init.sh`/executables named `.milpa/hooks/shell-init` and source them.

  These `shell-init` scripts should print shell-specific instructions that a user may `eval` during the initialization of a new shell prompt. The @milpa.shell bash functions will be available for script shells to facilitate printing `export` statements compatible with POSIX-compliant shells and `fish`.

  ### Using with bash, zsh, etc:

  On POSIX-compliant shells (zsh or bash, for example), you may add this to near the very end of shell profile (usually at `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`): `eval "$(!milpa! itself shell init)"`

  ### Using with fish:

  When using fish, you'll need to `eval (!milpa! itself shell init)` around the end of your `~/.config/fish/config.fish` file.

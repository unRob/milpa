You and your team write scripts and a little spec for each command. Use bash, or any other command, and `milpa` provides **autocompletions**, **subcommands**, **argument parsing** and **validation** so you can skip the toil and focus on your scripts.

For those in the know, it makes following these [Command Line Interface Guidelines](https://clig.dev/) easier.

`milpa` let's you have one or more "repos", or collections of commands. These are folders that contain a `.milpa` folder with scripts within. Check out [`milpa itself docs repo`](/docs/milpa/repo/) for more details about repositories.

Your milpa repos will contain commands and their corresponding specs, among other things. These can be executables written in whatever language you want, or bash shell scripts. Get the full story with [milpa itself docs command](/docs/milpa/command/)

description: how to deal with bugs in milpa
---

`milpa` is currently alpha software. This means that while I've personally tested it for over a year:

- test coverage is pretty lacking,
- the command spec and script environment is subject to change, and
- there's **no guarantee of stability** of any internal command or utility

description: Render markdown docs to the terminal or browser
---

`milpa` can render any markdown-formatted documents stored at `.milpa/docs` to the terminal and browser. Files must be named with an `.md` extension and may exist at any folder depth. Files named `.milpa/docs/whatever/index.md` may be displayed by running either `milpa help docs whatever` or `milpa help docs whatever index`

Documentation may also be served over HTTP, by starting a server with [`milpa help docs --server`](/.milpa/commands/help/docs#server-mode).

These docs are brought to you courtesy of the **Recursive Department of Departamental Recursiveness**.

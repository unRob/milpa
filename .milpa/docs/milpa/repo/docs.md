`!milpa` can render any markdown-formatted documents stored at `.milpa/docs` to the terminal. Files must be named with an `.md` extension and may exist at any folder depth. Files named `.milpa/docs/whatever/index.md` may be displayed by running either `!milpa! help docs whatever` or `!milpa! help docs whatever index`

Same docs are rendered to HTML, using the [`milpa itself docs html`](/.milpa/commands/itself/docs) command.

## [Upcoming](https://github.com/unRob/milpa/compare/dfa152673d41c22f7a99fd4a78641de9a65fdff1...HEAD)

### 🌱 Features

- Argument and flag run-time validation, so your command can focus on using them.
- Command line argument, flag autocomplete for your commands on bash, zsh and fish. Completions can come from other commands.
- Don't wanna write stuff over and over again? `milpa itself repo install` will come in handy to install remote milpa repos
- Drop your commands and specs in your project's `.milpa` folder, group them in folders and nest them, they'll become callable based on their path.
- Needs bash, old ones work fine! Companion binary does the argument parsing and fancy rendering heavy lifting, available wherever golang builds for.
- Readable `--help` on your terminal, searchable help on your browser. Same for docs that go along your commands.

### ðŸŒ± Features

- (dfa152) Command line argument, flag autocomplete for your commands on bash, zsh and fish. Completions can come from other commands.
- (dfa152) Don't wanna write stuff over and over again? `milpa itself repo install` will come in handy to install remote milpa repos.
- (dfa152) Drop your commands and specs in your project's `.milpa` folder, group them in folders and nest them, they'll become callable based on their path.
- (dfa152) Needs bash, old ones work fine! Companion binary does the argument parsing and fancy rendering heavy lifting, available wherever golang builds for.
